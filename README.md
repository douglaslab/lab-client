# Charlie - a DLIMS demo client

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/douglaslab/charlie)

This is a sample client, demonstrating the use of the [DLIMS API](https://github.com/douglaslab/alpha).

The client is a simple web app (built using Express) and demonstrates:

1. Logging users in/out.
1. Managing inventory items (CRUD).
1. Managing users (CRUD).
1. Managing action permissions.
1. Monitoring the audit log.
1. Checking API health.

The client's UI design is kept rudimentary on purpose. It uses Bootstrap to style the UI. It is meant to be used as a demo application, or as a base to build on.
