# lab-client: a Douglas Lab API demo client

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/douglaslab/lab-client)

This is a sample client, demonstrating the use of the [Douglas Lab API](https://github.com/douglaslab/lab-api).

The client is a simple web app (built using [Express](http://expressjs.com/)) and demonstrates:

1. Logging users in/out.
1. Managing users (CRUD).
1. Managing inventory items (CRUD).
1. Managing action permissions.
1. Monitoring the audit log.
1. Checking API health.

The client's UI design is intentionally kept rudimentary. It uses Bootstrap to style the UI. It is meant to be used as a demo application, or as a base to build upon.
